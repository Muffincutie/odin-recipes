    <H2>Description</H2>

    <p>You may have heard this story...a woman asks to buy a cookie recipe and is told it will cost 'two-fifty.' She thinks this means $2.50, but then she gets her credit card bill back and finds out it is $250.00. Outraged, she spreads the recipe far and wide to try and get her money's worth. I first heard this story 6 years ago and was given a recipe on a sheet of paper which bore the date '1986.' The supposed originator of the recipe was a well-known cookie company. I have since heard this tale again several times, with the recipe originating from different upscale department stores. True story? Who knows, but it's a darn good cookie. Here's my version.</p>

    <H2>Ingredients</H2>


    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar </li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups rolled oats</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>4 ounces milk chocolate, grated</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups chopped walnuts</li>

        <H2>Steps</H2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Measure oats into a blender or food processor, and then blend to a fine powder. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugars. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, oats, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Stir dry ingredients into creamed butter and sugar. Add chocolate chips, grated chocolate, and nuts.</li>
            <li>Drop by rounded teaspoons onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes in the preheated oven.</li>

        </ol>
        
        

    </ul>
