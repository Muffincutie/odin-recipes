    <H2>Description</H2>

    <p>You may have heard this story...a woman asks to buy a cookie recipe and is told it will cost 'two-fifty.' She thinks this means $2.50, but then she gets her credit card bill back and finds out it is $250.00. Outraged, she spreads the recipe far and wide to try and get her money's worth. I first heard this story 6 years ago and was given a recipe on a sheet of paper which bore the date '1986.' The supposed originator of the recipe was a well-known cookie company. I have since heard this tale again several times, with the recipe originating from different upscale department stores. True story? Who knows, but it's a darn good cookie. Here's my version.</p>

    <H2>Ingredients</H2>


        <ul>
            <li>1 medium banana</li>
            <li>2 eggs </li>
            <li>½ tablespoon ground cinnamonr</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon butter</li>
          
        </ul>

    <H2>Steps</H2>

        <ol>
            <li>Mash banana in a bowl; add eggs and beat until well incorporated. Add cinnamon and stir.</li>
            <li>Heat butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Pour a small amount of batter into the center of the skillet. Cook until pancake is firm, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip carefully and cook 1 minute more.</li>
            
        </ol>
